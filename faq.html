                <dt>What's a 'Song Builder?'</dt>
                <dd>I am primarily a singer and guitarist, and I often build the intensity and depth of performance utilizing live-looping, vocal percussion, and various effects pedals. The result is a fun, improvised, multi-layered orchestration including percussion, bass, rhythm and lead guitars, and vocal harmonies. I am also a composer and arranger of music, and my family has operated Maine lumber mills for generations.</dd>

                <dt>Oh, so you use backing tracks? Or a drum machines?</dt>
                <dd>Nope. Each song starts as a blank slate, and every sound you hear originates from my guitar or my microphone. <a href="">View a list of gear I use.</a></dd>

                <dt>Do you play with a band?</dt>
                <dd>For many weddings and larger events I love performing with other musicians. By utilizing the above-mentioned performance techniques (live-looping, octave-pedals), I'm able to create smaller format bands that include instrumentation usually resevered for larger bands (such as horns, hand percussion, cello, etc). <a href="">See some common band options.</a></dd>

                <dt>Are you a DJ?</dt>
                <dd>No, I perform live music. However, I'm happy to offer DJ-style playback during breaks and to keep the party going after the live music concludes. These DJ options are available on most of my event packages. Also, like a DJ, I am able to create on-the-fly "mashups" and exended mixes transitioning between multiple songs to keep the music flowing throughout the night without awkward gaps.</dd>

                <dt>So is this like karaoke?</dt>
                <dd><i class="fas fa-meh-rolling-eyes"></i></dd>

                <dt>What styles/genres of music do you play?</dt>
                <dd>I have an <a href="songlist.html">extensive repertoire</a> of nearly one thousand songs, encompassing popular music from the last 70 years. The bulk of those are Top 40 songs from the 70s through today, with a focus on pop and rock. Whether it's a relaxed setting or a wild dance party, the music will groove and your guests will too!</dd>

                <dt>How do you choose which songs you'll play?</dt>
                <dd>I rarely have a setlist, and rather I prefer to sculpt the musical progression in real-time; interacting with the audience and adjusting to the needs of the event and the energy they bring.</dd>

                <dt>Can we select the playlist for our event?</dt>
                <dd>For special events, I ask clients to provide basic "PLEASE PLAY" and "PLEASE AVOID" lists including artists, genres and/or specific songs. I also work directly with clients to select the DJ setlists for breaks or after-parties; this can be a great way to casually incorporate favorite songs that might not be in my repertoire.</dd>
                <dd>For weddings, I will work with the Bride and Groom to select specific songs for Processional, Recessional, First Dance, Parent Dances, and any other speciality songs. Most of <a href="">my wedding packages</a> also include me learning and arranging special request songs that are not already in <a href="songlist.html">my repertoire</a>.</dd>

                <dt>Where can we hear you perform live ?</dt>
                <dd>During this quarantine while bars and restaurants are closed, I've been <a href="live.html">live-streaming</a> every Friday night at 7:30pm mdt on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/benhammondmusic">my personal facebook profile</a>. The online audience actually regularly includes quite a few of my past wedding clients, which I consider a giant compliment!</dd>
                <dd>I post all of my upcoming public performances on <a href="shows.html">my shows page</a>, along with dozens of other event services (I actually wrote a Python script to automate this process if you're interested). Please note: the vast majority of these performances are solo, and will range in the overall vibe and danciness. Feel free to reach out and I can help you pick a fun gig that will best demonstrate the style you're seeking for your event.</dd>

Please <a href="mailto:me@benhammondmusic.com">email me</a> or fill in my <a href="contact.html">event form</a> with your details and I'll respond right away with several options.

                <dt>Once I'm ready to book, how to I pay you? Do you require a deposit? Do you use a contract?</dt>
                <dd>Once we have finalized which packages you'll need for your event, I'll send over a contract and an invoice. The contract is easily signed online (no printing or scanning or licking stamps!). I require 50% as deposit retainer to validate the contract. The remaining 50% will be due one month before your event. I can accept credit cards with no additional fee, or almost any other form of payment you might prefer.</dd>

                <dt>Can you hold a date for me without a deposit?</dt>
                <dd>Unfortunately no; I do need a signed contract and paid deposit to officially hold a date. If you aren't sure exactly which packages you'll need or which additional musicians you'll be adding, I am happy to lock in your date with just a solo booking, and then proceed with adding additional coverages at a later date.</dd>

                <dt>Do you perform at wedding ceremonies?</dt>
                <dd>Yes! Typically as a solo singer guitarist, or as a duo with my incredible cellist. However, I have a <a href="">wide range of options available</a>. Most wedding packages also include setup and operation of my wireless lapel microphones (lav mics) for the officiant and wireless handheld microphones on a stand for guests doing prayers or readings during your ceremony.</dd>

                <dt>Do you perform at cocktail hours?</dt>
                <dd>Yes!!</dd>

                <dt>Do you play at wedding receptions? With lots of dancing?</dt>
                <dd>Yes!!! With a vast repertoire of upbeat, energetic songs I can get everyone grooving all night whether it's with a band or as a solo act using live-looping and vocal percussion. <a href="">Check out some of the options</a>.</dd>

                <dt>We have already booked a different music vendor for our wedding, but we love your style and want to incorporate you somehow... any ideas?</dt>
                <dd>Of course! Frequently when couples want to include me but have already locked in a different vendor for the wedding reception, I will provide music for the welcome dinner / rehearsal dinner before the wedding day, or sometimes even an acoustic farewell brunch the morning after. Depending on your previously booked vendor, there is also the option to have me perform for ceremony and cocktail only, and then seamlessly transition to a DJ or different band for reception. I do this frequenly with <a href="http://www.greatimedj.com">Greatime DJ</a>.</dd>

                <dt>Will you function as our MC (Master of Ceremonies)?</dt>
                <dd>I am happy to make any announcements needed throughout the night, including announcing the wedding party, first dances, last call etc. I tend to be more on the conversational, friendly side and I'm decidely not an over the top, in-character announcer. My speaking style mirrors my music: high-energy and low-stress.</dd>

                <dt>Do you have experience with LGBTQ+ weddings?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Yes! <span class="icon"><img src="images/rainbow.svg" /></span>
                </dd>

                <dt>Do you have experience with Jewish weddings and traditions?</dt>
                <dd>Yes!</dd>

                <dt>Do you travel?</dt>
                <dd>Yes! I have been flown as far as New Zealand for private events, so there's a good chance I can travel for yours. Additional travel fees and lodging may apply to events more than 2 hours from Denver. <a href="mailto:me@benhammondmusic.com">Email me</a> for a custom quote.</dd>

                <dt>Do we need to tip you and any band members?</dt>
                <dd>No, tipping is not required. Many clients do, many clients do not. My prices are set to not rely on tips, however they are of course always appreciated. It's also convenient to tip via credit card if that's how you choose to pay.</dd>

                <dt>Are there any other hidden fees?</dt>
                <dd>Not really. As mentioned above, if you require various add-ons like extra special request songs, additional coverages, or other items not explicitely included in your purchased packages there may be additional fees. Also, you may be responisble for any non-standard costs incurred while performing at your event beyond driving (including paid parking, access permits, renting generators, etc).</dd>

                <dt>Do you accept credit cards?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, with no additional processing fee.</dd>

                <dt>What is your refund policy?</dt>
                <dd>In general, the deposit retainer is non-refundable, as I will have turned down other event oppurtunites to keep your date available. I will also have already spent time preparing, communicating and rehearsing. However, in extenuating circumstances or when I'm able to secure a replacement event on your date, I may be able to refund all or part of your deposit. Please <a href="mailto:me@benhammondmusic.com">email me</a> with more specific questions; my goal is to make sure every client is happy and is treated fairly.</dd>

          <div class="col-8 mb-8 mx-auto">
            <h2 class="list-section-heading"><i class="fas fa-microphone-alt"></i> Setup and Performance</h2>
            <div class="row">
              <dl class="faq-list mx-auto">
                <dt>What time will you arrive to setup your equipment and sound check?</dt>
                <dd>I will personally arrive up to 3 hours before an event, and at least 45 minutes before the start of a performance. The amount of time I need to setup is based on the size of the event, instrumentation, and complexity of the event. If you have venue restrictions on when vendors may arrive please let me know as soon as you can.</dd>
                <dd>We rarely need a conventional "sound check" and can easily setup silently when needed.</dd>
                <dd>If you require all band members to be set and ready more than one hour before showtime there may be additional hourly fees.</dd>

                <dt>Do you provide your own sound equipment (PA system, speakers, backup equipment, microphones, etc?)</dt>
                <dd>Yes!</dd>

                <dt>Do you provide extensive lighting and visual effects?</dt>
                <dd>No, but I can provide 2 LED PAR cans to illuminate the band and/or a small portion of the dance floor. For extensive "club" lighting you would have to contract a separate vendor.</dd>

                <dt>Do you require a stage?</dt>
                <dd>No, the vast majority of my performances are not on a stage; the closer to the dance floor the bette! I thrive on audience participation and an intimate connection with the listeners and dancers; I honestly find a giant stage can take away from that connection. However, we do require an even, solid surface area to setup on; depending on the venue a small stage might be a great fit. Whether or not a stage is to be used (we do not provide one) please allow at least 8x12 feet for a 3-4 piece band, 12x16 for a 5-6 piece.</dd>

                <dt>Can you perform outside?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, but some important caveats. All musicians will need to be out of direct sun, and have complete protection from any precipitation. We also may not be able to perform in extremely cold weather; having a backup indoor performance space is always recommended, particularly in unpredictable Colorado.</dd>

                <dt>Will you put up a sign, banner, CDs for sale, etc?</dt>
                <dd>Never at weddings, and rarely and only with client permission at certain events.</dd>

                <dt>Do you take breaks? How are the scheduled?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, all the musicians will require breaks. For 3 hour gigs we would generally take either two 10-15 minute breaks or one 25-30 minute break. We are quite flexible, and can schedule any short breaks to coordinate with the event schedule.</dd>
                <dd>We also will require food at all events where a meal is served; ideally we can eat slightly before the rest of the guests so we are ready to start rocking as they are finishing their meal.</dd>
                <dd>There will always be recorded music playing during any breaks in the live music, to keep the energy flowing throughout the event.</dd>

                <dt>Can we use your microphone for speeches, toasts and announcements?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, most of my event packages include setup and operation of a second, wireless microphone for clients to use. I will be continuously using sanitizing wipes on this microphone between speeches to protect the health of you and your guests.</dd>
                <dd>Unfortunately due to equipment liability and health concerns, I will not allow anyone to use my personal microphone at any time.</dd>

                <dt>Can we request songs during the event? Will you take requests from our guests?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, I love an interactive crowd and enjoy catering to an engaged audience! If possible it's great when requests can be written down (so I don't forget), and at weddings we will honor the bride and groom if they ask us you stick with our previously chosen tunes.</dd>

                <dt>What is we are having a blast and want you to keep playing past the end of our scheduled time?</dt>
                <dd>If agreed upon by the band, it's possible we can play longer for a pro-rated hourly amount. However, it's important to remember that the longer we stay, the later the cleanup crew, rental pickup, and venue coordinators will have to stay. We will not play later than the alloted venue time, and will do our best to respect the time of all vendors involved.</dd>
                <dd>For this reason, I've started offering late-night DJ sets, where we can keep music going after the band finishes. This can be a cue to your crowd that the night is winding down, while still keeping the dedicated partiers going strong on the dancefloor. This also saves you a lot of money, versus hiring the entire band for the extra time.</dd>

                <dd>No, I do not. If it's a venue where I've never performed, it can be very helpful if you or the venue can provide some simple photos and floorplans, however my level of experience and pro equipment allows me to perform pretty much in any setting.</dd>

                <dt>Will you be attending our ceremony rehearsal?</dt>
                <dd>No, there is a good chance I'll be performing at another event. All cues and coordination will be discussed with you or your coordinator by email ahead of time, and confirmed with your officiant directly before the ceremony.</dd>

                <dt>Do you carry insurance?</dt>
                <dd>My vehicle carries a one million dollar commerical liabilty policy, which is required by Vail Resorts and many others to access on-mountain sites. When required by the venue, I obtain a one-day certificate of liabilty insurance specific to the configuration needed (solo vs. band, etc).</dd>

                <dt>What is the backup plan in case of performer illness?</dt>
                <dd>In over 15 years of performing at weddings I have had to cancel precisely zero times due to illness. However, I have a strong and supportive network of professional musicians nationwide whom I trust to do an excellent job on short notice (whether that be replacing me as a vocalist and guitarist, or any added musicians I was planning to use). I also work closely with several pro DJ companies who would be able to provide top-notch musical entertainment and sound reinforcement if live music was somehow unavailable. In any case, your balance would be adjusted accordingly, and every effort would be made to have the show go on!</dd>

                <dt>Do we need a planner? Won't you be our day-of coordinator and run the event as MC?</dt>
                <dd>If you are having a casual party, then you might not need a planner. However, if your event is going to be a *production*, then yes, I strongly recommend hiring a planner and a day-of. As MC I will make all needed announcements and do my best to keep things on schedule, but I will not be able to function as your day-of.Leading up to the event I am also more than happy to offer my thoughts and ideas on incorporating the music to keep the energy flowing all night and avoiding awkward transition.</dd>
                <dd>As a note: you should be aware that your 'venue coordinator' is generally there primarily for the venue, and not specifically for you or your other vendors. A good day-of is well worth their cost; please <a href="mailto:me@benhammondmusic.com">let me know</a> if you'd like any recommendations.</dd>

                <dt>COVID STATEMENT</dt>
                <dd>Though my deposit retainers are contractually non-refundable, I have offered to fully refund all events impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as needed. Many clients are choosing to elope or have extremely intimate ceremonies this year, and are rescheduling their full blown reception for 2021. I am very supportive of this plan, and recommend impacted couples choose a backup date NOW. I also recommend those casually planning a 2021 event start booking their vendors ASAP, as the 2021 season will fill-up quickly.</dd>
