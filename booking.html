						He was happy to do all of our announcements and he not only learned some specific songs for us, he also added personal touches that made the music throughout the night all about us. People around our neighborhood have even come by and told us how much they enjoyed listening to him. As far as logistics, Ben’s contract, pricing and questionnaires are straight forward, easy to complete and Ben is just an email away ready to help whenever you need.

He ALWAYS had a smile on his face. Ben is attentive to details, he arrived earlier than I expected and was prepared. Compared to some of the vendors we used, he did not have to be managed at any time. He followed his schedule, making adjustments as needed. Ben was a joy to work with. Thank you for your impeccable level of service and your exceptional musical talent. I love your gravelly voice too. -->
